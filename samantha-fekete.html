These days, they get tens of thousands of views on each of their videos.&nbsp;Moreover, she makes regular appearances on videos made for Hi5’s other channels. She’s one of the youngest employees of Hi5 Studios.</p><p>As an actress, her first job was in an episode of the web series ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Roommates</a>’ (2016).
