<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Meghan Markle Workout and Diet Plans</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2><strong>Meghan Markle Workout and Diet Secrets for Her Royal Wedding</strong></h2><p>You have always known her as Rachel Zane from the popular show Suits (2011-Present) where she plays an intelligent, sassy and confident attorney. But now, Meghan Markle is a bride to be, and she is marrying none other than Prince Harry of Wales KCVO. The royal wedding is expected to take place on 19th May 2018, and people are all excited about it. If you are also interested in the wedding or how the bride to be is preparing herself for the big day, here are a few things that might interest you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Meghan-Markle-having-a-drink-during-a-photoshoot-with-Good-Housekeeping-in-August-2016.jpg><h3><strong>Meghan Markle Wedding Workout Secrets</strong></h3><p>The actress is a huge fan of Pilates Platinum and calls it the best thing a person can do for his/her body. She keeps coming back to it due to several reasons, one of which is that her body changes immediately and she can see the results in only two classes.</p><p>Apart from this ingenious exercise method, she also does a lot of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>yoga</a>, jogging and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>running</a>. She stays self-motivated for exercising and says that if you do that you win half the battle.</p><p>Though it is not confirmed whether the diva is still following these exercises to prepare for the wedding but it is highly probable.</p><h3><strong>Why Pilates Platinum is Different</strong></h3><p>If you have never heard of Pilates Platinum and you wish to know why it’s different, then you are in luck. The creator of the Megaformer machine, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Sebastien Lagree</a> recently talked about this. He said that Megaformer was designed to help clients get a high-intensity and low impact workout. It helps you to strengthen, tighten, and tone the body in a quick and safe manner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Meghan-Markle-during-a-photoshoot-with-Good-Housekeeping-in-August-2016.jpg><p>As compared to traditional Pilates reformer machine that is mainly used to rehabilitate your muscles, this new invention is made for only high-intensity workouts. You should visit at least two or three times a week to see consistent results. You can see the results from your third visit.</p><p>Lagree also said that this workout option is a good one for the brides to be or people who want to transform their bodies because it offers quick results.</p><h3><strong>Meghan Markle Diet Secret</strong></h3><p>Meghan admits to being a foodie, but she still manages to look great by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eating everything in moderation</a>.</p><h3><strong>Diet to Keep a Check on Weight</strong></h3><p>When the LA-born is hoping to keep her weight in check (something most brides do), she cuts out <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>gluten foods</a> from her diet and tries to be more <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>vegan</a>. She also reduces wine intake and tries to resist a big bowl of pasta (which is another weakness).</p><h3><strong>Staying</strong> <strong>Energized</strong></h3><p>To stay energized, the stunner never takes the help of coffee. Instead, she has a green juice because it’s a natural energy source. She calls it a nice pick me up because it gets right into her system and gives quick results.</p><h3><strong>Some Downtime is a Must</strong></h3><p>When in need of some downtime, she takes an hour to watch mindless TV, decompress, snuggle with her dogs and have a glass of wine.</p><h3><strong>Sprucing Up</strong></h3><p>When the Duchess-to-be needs to prepare for a red carpet, she takes the help of a team and spends an hour on makeup and hair. But if she is going out with friends, she just needs 15 minutes to get ready. Out of these 15 minutes, she spends 5 minutes on her face and mostly opts for wearing her hair up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Meghan-Markle-during-a-chat-with-Good-Housekeeping-in-August-2016.jpg><h3><strong>Best Fitness and Beauty Secrets</strong></h3><p>The number one fitness advice shared by the beauty is that you should always hydrate. Your skin will look good, and you will feel better if you have enough water in a day. She also recommends using coconut oil for everything, from cooking to skin care and even hair care.</p><h3><strong>How to Look Stunning?</strong></h3><p>The easiest thing you can do to look stunning is to smile. It will make you prettier. (Such a nice thing to say!)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqacoKCRo3qurdGko55lp6S%2FrLvUrWSdoZWperG4wKeqaGpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abram-elam-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Abram Elam Net Worth</span></a>
