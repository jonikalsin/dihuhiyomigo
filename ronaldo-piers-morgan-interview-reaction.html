They believed, but in the same way, I’m never going to change the health of my family for football. Never. Now, or ten years behind or forward.</p><p>“It’s something that really hurt me because they doubted my word that I struggled, especially Belle and Geo (Ronaldo’s wife, Georgina Rodriguez), we had one week in hospital because Belle had a big problem.</p><p>“I didn’t go to pre-season because of that, because I wasn’t allowed to leave my family in case something happened. I don’t think that’s fair, to leave my family for pre-season, and that’s why I didn’t go.”</p><p>Ronaldo’s claims that United did not believe his daughter was ill during pre-season are countered privately by the club. Time off was sanctioned and Ten Hag only referenced “personal reasons” during the tour so as not to divulge details, while senior officials absolutely believed the reason Ronaldo gave for his absence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46rpqeZnJm8brzInqmsZZ2kv6itzWagp6yVp8OqsdZmqZ6Zk6m2sLqOom2LaJKchXGXsrOPaHqHbpO1kcqgpq6woWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nnanna-egwu.html><span>←</span><span>Nnanna Egwu</span></a>
