<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Dalvin Cook Fantasy Outlook: Is Jets RB a Good Pick in 2023?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Dalvin Cook has been a fantasy football powerhouse over the last few years as the starting running back for the Minnesota Vikings. His breakaway speed, ability to catch out of the backfield, and overall versatility made him an elite option. However, times have changed as Cook was cut by the Vikings and has since signed with the New York Jets. He is expected to be the backup to Breece Hall or at least share carries with him. So what does this mean for his 2023 fantasy outlook? Let’s dive in.</p><h2><span id=Dalvin_Cook_Fantasy_Outlook_2023_New_Team_New_Role><strong>Dalvin Cook Fantasy Outlook 2023: New Team, New Role</strong></span></h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportzhive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Should-you-Draft-Dalvin-Cook-in-Fantasy-Football.jpg></p><p>Cook is stepping into a significantly different role with the Jets. The team expects Breece Hall to recover fully from his ACL injury by Week 1, which puts Cook in a secondary position. For fantasy owners, this should signal caution. Being a backup or sharing carries limits the number of opportunities Cook will get, making him less of an attractive option than when he was a workhorse back in Minnesota.</p><h2><span id=The_Breece_Hall_Factor><strong>The Breece Hall Factor</strong></span></h2><p>The presence of Breece Hall can’t be ignored when discussing Cook’s fantasy outlook. Hall is expected to carry the bulk of the load, and given his draft stock in fantasy leagues, it’s clear that most managers expect him to bounce back from his injury effectively. This puts Cook at a disadvantage. While it’s possible that Hall might need some time to get back to his old form, the Jets are committed to him as their main guy. Cook might fill in nicely in the early weeks, but as Hall regains form, Cook’s role is likely to diminish.</p><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=# rel=noopener>#Madden24</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#DalvinCook</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#X</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/08HOK1MteQ</a></p><p>— Jaheim Fernanders (@Jscorpio2002) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 30, 2023</a></p><h2><span id=Predictable_Stats><strong>Predictable Stats</strong></span></h2><p>In the most optimistic scenario, Cook will share carries equally with Hall. Even then, you’re likely looking at 10-15 carries and a few targets per game for Cook. This will naturally result in some touchdowns, but not nearly as many as you’d like from a starting fantasy running back. This role may not offer the ceiling we’re accustomed to when considering Cook’s previous stats, making him a riskier pick in this year’s draft.</p><p><strong>People Also Read:</strong> <a href=#>10 Best Fantasy Football Defense Picks for 2023</a></p><h2><span id=Other_Options_Abound><strong>Other Options Abound</strong></span></h2><p>In fantasy drafts, the goal is to pick players who will dominate touches and produce high stats. Players like Aaron Jones, Breece Hall, and Jahmyr Gibbs are clear-cut starters who will likely receive 80% or more of the touches on their respective teams. Even in the later rounds, you may find more intriguing options with higher upside than Cook, such as emerging rookies or sleepers that could potentially take over a backfield.</p><p><strong>People Also Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Terry McLaurin Fantasy Outlook 2023: Is Commanders’ WR a Good Pick?</a></p><p>Dalvin Cook is a household name in fantasy football, but the 2023 season presents a new set of challenges that downgrade his draft value. With a new team and role, and competition from a highly touted back like Breece Hall, Cook’s fantasy prospects are not as bright as in previous years. He might provide some value as a bye-week filler or an injury replacement, but the days of considering him a must-start RB1 seem to be behind him. Draft with caution and adjust your expectations for Dalvin Cook in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FtcbHoq2eZpOkunC6xaVmnZmcq7avecKopqRllpa7ta3SsmSoraShvLC3jKKqZqKVqcBuvsFmmGafn6SxbrzInKJmoZ5if3F%2Bkmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coleman-laffoon.html><span>←</span><span>Coleman Laffoon Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
