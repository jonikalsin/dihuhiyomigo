The building process took more than eight years, but Newman says it was well worth the wait.</p><p>“I wanted to do more than make donuts,” Newman said to <a href=# rel=noopener>USA Today</a>, talking about his job at the local bakery. “I’ve built me quite a house out here. After all, a man’s home is his castle.”</p><p>The building began after Newman purchased a 20-acre plot in Bellville, Texas.</p><p>“I came out here one afternoon with a lawn chair… and a bottle of champagne also,” Newman said. “I sat in the lawn chair and started looking around, trying to envision things.”</p><p>Newman wanted the castle to fit his preferences to a tee, so he decided to forgo the contractors and build the castle with only the help of a single assistant.</p><p>In total, the building process took many years to complete, but by the end, Newman had built himself a medieval-style fortress in the woods of Texas.</p><p>The castle features a full moat (“watch out for gators!” the website advises), a working drawbridge, a 64-foot tall bell tower, a chapel, and even a dungeon.</p><p>For Newman, who currently lives in the castle, the structure is a testament to his abilities as a builder.</p><p>“I have actually looked up at some of these things and say, ‘Did I actually build that?'” Newman said to USA Today. “It’s very self-rewarding.”</p><p>But with a whole castle to himself, Newman resolved to share his creation with the world and opened up his home to curious visitors.</p><h2>Making Newman’s Castle A Home — And Then A Tourist Destination</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-439782 alt="Newman's Castle Architecture" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newmans-castle-architecture.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-439782 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Newman’s Castle</span><span class=caption-body>View of the castle’s design from the courtyard.</span></p><p>Newman decided to combine both of his worlds — one as the life of a baker and the other as a king of a castle — to create an engaging, and delicious, tour of his home.</p><p>“We host tours from one or two people to 100,” Newman told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Houston Chronicle</a>.</p><p>The tour begins at Newman’s Bakery, continues with a bus ride through the country, and culminates in a nearly two-hour-long journey back in time to the medieval period.</p><p>In particular, children and their parents most often flock to the castle for a mini history lesson.</p><p>“We see a lot of school children and Boy-and-Girl-Scout [troops]. I think the castle acts as an inspiration to kids. They see that they can make their dreams come true if they work at it,” Newman said.</p><p>On some tours, Newman passes out wooden swords to the children and performs a knighting ceremony. Then, he usually moves on to demonstrate how his on-site trebuchet works.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-439783 alt="Trebuchet At Newman's Castle" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/trebuchet.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-439783 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Newman’s Castle</span><span class=caption-body>The castle is equipped with a trebuchet, a medieval weapon that projects stones.</span></p><p>Next, Newman encourages the children to “storm” the castle, stopping at the 3,000-pound drawbridge wheel to lower and close it.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-439780 alt="Castle Drawbridge" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/castle-drawbridge.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-439780 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Newman’s Castle</span><span class=caption-body>Visitors to the castle help bring in the drawbridge.</span></p><p>Inside the castle, Newman leads his guests on a tour through the great hall, dungeon, chapel, and even his personal living quarters.</p><p>From there, the tour stops in the dining hall to enjoy a lunch provided by Newman’s bakery in true medieval banquet fashion.</p><h2>Newman’s Castle’s Impact On Its Rural Texas Surroundings</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-439781 alt="Dining Hall Of Newman's Castle" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/castle-interior.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-439781 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Newman’s Castle</span><span class=caption-body>The dining hall of Newman’s Castle.</span></p><p>Despite leading hundreds of tours, Newman still finds every single one rewarding.</p><p>“I’m still having a good time. Especially, if you see other people happy, it’s easy for me to appreciate that… The [positivity] that comes from it from my point of view has been, wow, thank you Lord. You know, it’s just like a gift from above,” he said to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Texas Bucket List</a>.</p><p>Today, Newman’s Castle is open for several events, including weddings, wine tastings, birthdays, and even murder mystery parties.</p><p>The castle continues to be Newman’s primary residence, and he is currently working on expanding the building to include a guest wing.</p><p>“For me, I think it is something like an artistic expression. I am a craftsman and mechanically inclined, and working on the castle lets me use those skills. I am building some guest rooms in it now so I can host retreats.”</p><p>“It also keeps me from getting bored,” Newman laughed to the Houston Chronicle.</p><p>Furthermore, the castle has benefited not just Newman but the whole town of Bellville.</p><p>“Mike’s castle put Bellville on the map,” 23-year resident, Don Lawrence, said. “Our town’s tourism has doubled because of it. The craftsmanship of the whole thing is unbelievable. In fact, everything Mike does is amazing.”</p><p>With the overwhelming interest and support for his passion project, Newman feels he is giving back to his hometown and improving his own life.</p><p>“I’m very happy to be from here and I’m very pleased and honored to have so many people come out here to my castle to see it. But then there’s a great overflow of that because they get to spend a little time here in a small community, here in Texas,” he said.</p><p>After learning about Newman’s Castle, go inside Germany’s <a href=#>Neuschwanstein Castle</a>, the inspiration for Disney’s Sleeping Beauty castle.
