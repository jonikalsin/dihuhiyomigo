<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Yes, Niya Morant Related To Ja Morant | Age Gap And Family Ethnicity</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>American-born basketball player Ja Morant is talented. The point guard from South Carolina plays for the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies. The 23-year-old athlete represented Murray State Racers in collegiate basketball.</strong></p><p>Ja was a second-year college player who was a unanimous first-team All-American in 2019. Morant was selected by the Memphis Grizzlies as the second overall selection in the 2019 NBA Draft. Did you know that Ja Morant comes from a basketball family? His brothers and dad were all renowned basketball players.</p><h2><span id=Yes_Niya_Morant_and_Ja_Morant_are_related_The_age_difference_between_a_brother_and_a_sister>Yes, Niya Morant and Ja Morant are related. The age difference between a brother and a sister</span></h2><p>Ja Morant’s younger sibling is Niya Morant. Teniya Morant is her true name, but everyone calls her Niya with fondness. Ja Morant was conceived on August 10th, 1999. On the other side, Teniya Morant, his sister, was born on February 18, 2005. Ja Morant will be 23 in 2023, while Niya Morant will be 18 then. The age difference between the brother and sister is therefore six years.</p><p>Ja has a strong relationship with his sister Niya Morant. The tight relationship between the siblings draws notice often. On Valentine’s Day 2022, the Memphis Grizzlies point guard gave his sister the brand-new Jeep Wrangler she had always wanted.</p><p>The point guard posted a photo of the touching occasion on his Instagram. Before heading to the vehicle in shock, Teniya started sobbing happy, excited tears, and embraced her older brother.</p><p>Ja Morant was beaming broadly. Niya’s birthday was coming up, and because it was Valentine’s Day, the adored brother also considered giving his sister her ideal vehicle. Ja captioned the picture, “Happy Valentine’s Day and early birthday, little sister.”</p><h2><span id=Morant_Sister_Ja_Additionally_Niya_Morant_Plays_Basketball>Morant Sister, Ja Additionally, Niya Morant Plays Basketball</span></h2><p>When they were young, the Morant siblings engaged in cooperative play. At Dalzell’s Hillcrest Middle School, Niya started her basketball career. She is now a student at Houston High School in Germantown, Tennessee.</p><p>The public has paid close attention to Niya’s high school playing career on social media. One of the videos included her outstanding performance in the game, as she led her high school team to a 65-51 win against Arlington High School with 20 points and 10 rebounds.</p><p>Point guard Niya Morant is quick and nimble. One day, she could be eligible to compete in the WNBA. The gifted basketball player belongs to the 2023 class. She must now determine what she wants to do with her life since she is prepared to graduate.</p><p>Her brother and dad want her to continue playing basketball while attending college. She’ll probably go on playing for the remainder of her collegiate career before choosing whether or not she join the WNBA.</p><p>She has the potential to play professionally, but we’ll have to wait and see whether she gets some height and excels in college basketball.</p><h2><span id=Ja_Morant8217s_Family_Ethnicity_and_Parents>Ja Morant’s Family, Ethnicity, and Parents</span></h2><p>Tee and Jamie Morant gave birth to Ja and Niya Morant. They were both basketball players in the past. Jamie Morant, Ja Morant’s mother, used to be a high school point guard. When she was a college student, she played softball.</p><p>Tee Morant did the same thing while playing basketball at Claflin University. Ray Allen played on the same squad as Tee in high school. The father of Ja and Niya thought of playing professionally abroad. Tee gave up his sporting career to become a barber once Jamie got pregnant with Ja.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Viggo Sorensen</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Avivasofia</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Giselle Guilmette</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Basketball Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>How Old Was Danielle Van T Schip | Wikipedia</a></h3>Danielle Van T Schip, the daughter of Willeke Alberti and Joop Oonk, passed away at the age of 55.
