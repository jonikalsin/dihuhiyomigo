YOU GUYS WOULD BE ADORABLE.” @cosmicalbabe, another user, expressed similar sentiments, writing, “all need to date irl already…”</p><p>But, despite their on-screen chemistry, the couple is not dating in real life. According to Cinemaholic, Morris answered the fans’ questions by emphasizing that he and Pedrad were simply friends.</p><p>Cinnaholic, on the other hand, provides no source or actual quotes from Morris to back up their claims.

Pedrad portrayed a major character in the Netflix film, Wesley. The plot of the film starts when Pedrad’s character sends an angry email to her boyfriend, believing he has ghosted her. But he was recently involved in an accident in Mexico.</p><p>She travels to Mexico with her two best friends, fearful that the email will ruin her relationship. On the way, she runs into Morris’ character Sean, whom she had previously dated. Pedrad and Morris become entangled in their own private affairs on their journey to right her wrong.</p><h2 class=entry-title>Lamorne Morris: Ex-Girlfriend</h2><p>Morris never admitted to being in a relationship with Lim, but they were seen together a few times in public.
