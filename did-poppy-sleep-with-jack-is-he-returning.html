Is He Returning?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The moment&nbsp;Bold & Beautiful‘s Bill and Poppy crossed paths, viewers began speculating that he would turn out to be Luna’s dad. After all, they’d shared a night — sorry, a&nbsp;magical&nbsp;night — right around the same time that Luna would have been conceived, so it seemed pretty obvious.</p><p>But not so fast, we found ourselves thinking. Even for a show that likes to telegraph plot points in advance, this seemed like far too simple a story. Where was the drama? And when we talked to Poppy’s portrayer, Romy Park, she got a bit vague when it came to why Li had such a hate-on for her sister. “There might be more to it than simple jealousy,” she teased.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Poppy-Li-BB-HW.jpg alt="Poppy Li B&B" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Ya think?</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Now we find out</a> that Poppy stayed with Li and her then-husband, Jack, for a while. And huh, wouldn’t you know, it was about a year before Luna was born. And isn’t it interesting that when Luna suggested getting a DNA test, there weren’t enough “special mints” on the planet to keep her mom from freaking out.</p><p>It now seems pretty clear that Jack is Luna’s dad. But who, newer viewers might wonder, is Jack? So let us fill in a few blanks for you… which will also help explain why this kinda sorta makes sense.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jack-Li-BB-CBS.jpg alt="Jack, Li B&B" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Jack is the now ex-husband of Li… and the reason they’re divorced plays right into this latest storyline. Because years ago, Jack had an affair while married to Li. No, no, we’re not talking about what may or may not (but likely did) happen with Poppy, but rather his fling with Sheila.</p><p>We know that Sheila and Jack’s affair produced Finn, and that Jack managed to convince his lover to put her child up for adoption… only to raise that child with his wife! It wasn’t until years later, after Finn fell in love with and married Steffy, that Sheila literally emerged from the shadows and the whole twisted story came to light.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/JPI_Episode9009_0002027908-e1683046817271.jpg alt="Sheila Jack B&B" width=1230 height=719 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Here’s the real reason Poppy’s lying!</a></p><p>So we know that Jack has a propensity for cheating. Given that Finn is several years older than Luna, it now appears that Sheila may not have been the only woman who shared his bed and later gave him a child! That said, we still have more than a few questions.</p><p>• Does Li know about the affair, and could that be the real&nbsp;reason she’s so hateful toward Poppy?</p><p>• If Jack really is Luna’s father, how far would Poppy go to keep this from coming to light? Might she decide to change her tune and claim that Bill is, in fact, the father, if only to create peace within her family?</p><p>• And with Jack’s name being bandied about, does this mean his portrayer, Ted King, might soon be back on the canvas?</p><p><strong>As we contemplate the possibility (probability?) of Jack returning, here’s a comprehensive guide to <a href=# rel=noopener>all of the entrances and exits</a> we’ve seen so far in 2024 o soaps!&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmraCVYq%2BwuMNmmKecXam1pnnBnpiurJmbwq17zZ6urGdnZoNxgo9om6KcXaW8sbzYZqqlnZWleri106Fko5mToHqqv4yhnGaqlanCs7rIp55o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bonnie-bella-jordan.html><span>←</span><span>BonnieBella Jordan</span></a>
