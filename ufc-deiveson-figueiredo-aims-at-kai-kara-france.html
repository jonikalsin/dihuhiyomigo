The three back-to-back fights were all close calls and saw both fighters come out with a victory each after their first bout ended in a draw. Their fourth fight is already in the works according to MMA reporter Ariel Helwani but it looks like the champion isn’t eager to run it back yet again.</p><p>Instead, his call out of Kara-France shows he’s eager to fight new blood, especially since his recent success proves he’ll be a worthy contender. Kai’s recent fight upped his win streak to 3 and his unanimous decision victory over #2 Askarov will bump him up in the rankings when the UFC updates it next week. Moreno clapped back on Instagram, writing “To @daico_deusdaguerra her ovaries hurt and she doesn’t want to fight!! What do you think of an interim against @kaikarafrance while the gremlin gets eggs again.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Figueiredo kept his matchmaker hat on tweeting that Moreno would have to beat Alexandre Pantoja before ‘The God of War’ before getting a title shot. Pantoja 2-0 in fights with Moreno, his first victory over Moreno coming via at The Ultimate Fighter 24 and beating him again at <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UFC Fight Night: Maia vs Usman</a></strong> back in 2018. Pantoja would have already fought for the title had it not been for a knee injury that forced him to the sidelines. Pantoja tweeted back at Figueiredo “Be careful what you wish for! @danawhite let’s get the contract!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>It will be interesting to see what the UFC does next considering both Figueiredo and Moreno have suggested fights with other opponents while they were setting up a 4th fight between the two.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>Read: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UFC Columbus: Kai Kara France’s victory against Askar Askarov owed to strategic defence takedowns</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kai Kara-France beats Askar Askarov in back and forth battle</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG-20220327-WA0058-1024x576.jpg><p>Kai Kara-France was in the flyweight top ten heading into his fight with Askar Askarov at UFC Fight Night: Blaydes vs Daukaus. Askarov was #2 and both fighters were gunning for the title fight. However, Askarov won’t get the opportunity as Kara-France beat him, potentially earning a title fight for himself.</p><p>Askarov was looking for the takedown the entire fight and managed to keep it on the ground for almost all of the first round. Kai kept it on the feet for the second and hurt Askarov multiple times but couldn’t get the finish. The third saw more domination by Kai Kara-France on the feet while Askarov unsuccessfully tried to get it to the ground. The judge’s card was in favor of Kara-France, his rank will be updated.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kai Kara-France commemorates the completion of his training camp ahead of highly anticipated fight against Askar Askarov</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK571J%2BaZpyVnsOmv86nZJ%2Bhl6qyqr7EnaZmmZmiwG6t02aimqFdoK6zrYyfqZqmk5p8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oryan-dotes-on-his-and-jhene-aikos-daughter-in-new-photos.html><span>←</span><span>ORYAN DOTES ON HIS AND JHENE AIKOS DAUGHTER IN NEW PHOTOS</span></a>
