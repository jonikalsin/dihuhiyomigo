The accident happened six days after the historic win of the Red Wings in the Stanley Cup after 42 years.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614></span>Konstantinov, fellow Russian hockey legend Viacheslav Fetisov and the Red Wings’ team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov were out for a golf day on June 13, 1997, to celebrate the Wings’ Stanley Cup win.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/pimiso.com/ezoimgfmt/api.pimiso.com/uploads/2022/7/50d0faea-412f-4d9b-a8a4-563338c76b87.webp?ezimgfmt=rs:856x701/rscb2/ng:webp/ngcb2"><p>The trio had called for a limo to return home that night, only to end up in a disastrous road accident. The limo’s driver, Richard Gnida, held a suspended license for drunk driving at that time.</p><p>On that unfateful night, the driver lost control of the vehicle and hit a tree on the median of Woodward Avenue in Birmingham, Michigan.</p><p>The accident resulted in Vladimir retiring from his fire-up career and taking help from caretakers even to this day.</p><h2 id=update-on-the-vladinator-vladimir-konstantinov-accident-and-injury>Update On The Vladinator Vladimir Konstantinov Accident and Injury</h2><p>Vladimir Konstantinov spent several weeks in a coma after the limousine crash, devastating news to his fanbase, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Washington Post</a>.</p><p>He had suffered from severe head injuries and paralysis, while he has made constant progress in his health throughout these years.</p><p>Meanwhile, the other passenger on the limo, Fetisov, suffered from relatively minor injuries and was able to return to his games the following season.</p><p></p><p>However, the other person, Mnatsakanov, sustained significant head injuries and spent some time in a coma. Reports suggest that he has had a considerably more difficult recovery than Vladimir.</p><p>The Vladinator mainly suffered injuries to his brain, especially in part to the left frontal lobe. Thus, he could not process and connect to idealistic feelings from before.</p><h2 id=where-is-vladimir-konstantinov-now>Where Is Vladimir Konstantinov Now?</h2><p>Vladimir Konstantinov now lives in a condo in West Bloomfield, Michigan. Detriot Free Press&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>reports&nbsp;</a>that a group of ladies’ caretakers look after him and provide him with 24-hour assistance.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616></span>The women cook his meals, feed him, bathe him and help him get dressed. Vladimir, too, is comfortable with the caregivers and communicates well with them.</p><p>The report suggests that Konstantinov lives a simple life today. He goes to rehab and spends time at Costco as he enjoys shopping, bowling, and playing Uno.</p><h2 id=vladimir-konstantinov-has-a-wife-irina-and-family>Vladimir Konstantinov Has A Wife Irina And Family</h2><p>During his peak, Vladimir Konstantinov was once the face of Detriot Red Wings and the Soviet Union national ice hockey team.</p><p>Vlad the Impaler has a wife, Irina, who has been actively discussing his health conditions in the media.
