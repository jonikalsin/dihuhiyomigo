The veteran actress recently stopped by the Tamron Hall Show to give an update about her family.</p><p>“The babies are amazing,” Keshia shared. “My little one is six months; it’s going so fast.”</p><p>Keshia Knight Pulliam and Brad James welcomed their son earlier this year. <a href=#>The couple</a> decided to name their little one Knight as a way to honor his mom’s middle name.</p><p>“I’ve always known that I would like to name my son Knight because that’s my middle name,” Keshia told Tamron Hall. “And then James, of course, it’s a family name on both sides,” she added. “My dad’s name is James, my grandfather. So it all worked out. My husband’s last name. It just all worked out together.”</p><p></p><p>Knight James is <a href=#>Keshia and Brad’s first child together</a>. The couple tied the matrimonial knot in 2021. Keshia’s oldest daughter, Ella Grace, is with her first husband, Edgerton Hartwell.</p><p>“My greatest job I’ve ever had is being a mother,” Keshia told Tamron Hall. “It tops everything,” she added. The actress went on to delve into her parenting approach when rearing her daughter.</p><p>“It’s crazy because my parents always joke with me. They’re like, ‘You know what? I have no clue how you gave birth to yourself. But you have given birth to yourself,’” the celebrity mom joked. “Not only does [Ella Grace] look the spitting image of me when I was her age, but that personality. She is me! She gives it back to me, boy, let me tell you,” the actress exclaimed.</p><p>“But I love it because I think as parents when you have such determined, strong-willed, confident children, historically, our parents [believed] children should be seen and not heard and all of these things. But that’s not the child that I’m raising,” <a href=#>Keshia</a> explained.</p><p>“These are qualities I know that, as a woman, are going to serve her. So my desire is to amplify, to encourage, [and] to empower her with the understanding that you still have to be respectful, and all of that. But it’s to nurture those qualities in her because I want a child, and a daughter, who is going to speak up, who is going to speak truth, who is going to believe in herself – and she already does.”</p><p>Ella Grace celebrates her seventh birthday in January. Keshia Knight Pulliam and Brad James commemorated two years of marriage in September.</p><p>Photo: Keshia Knight Pulliam/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWxmamlfZYJwt8Ssn6KZXaC7qrPHrWSprZyhtqK5jJqlnWWSp66lecmapJ6rXZy2t7GMn5imoZyuera8w5qrnmWfo3q1rcyrpqdlmJa5rXnSoaawZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-a-shaw.html><span>←</span><span>Kate A.
