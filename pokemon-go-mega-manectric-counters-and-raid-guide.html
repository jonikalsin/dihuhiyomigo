This was the surprise Mega evolved Pokémon promised a while back, with this acting as his debut in the game. Players will now be able to collect Manectric Mega Energy via raids and research as well as by catching Electrike and Manectric in the wild. But to win those raids you need the very best Mega Manectric counters in Pokémon GO, so here’s our full raid guide.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Best Mega Manectric Counters</h2><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>As an Electric type Pokémon, Mega Manectric’s best counters are mostly Ground type attackers..There’s a lot of good options here, and we list some of the very best below. For this list we stuck to strandard Pokémon, but keep reading for more on Mega and Shadow counters against Mega Manectric.</p><table data-injectable=false><tbody><tr class=table-head><td>Pokémon</td><td>Fast Attack</td><td>Charged Attack</td></tr><tr><td>Groudon</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Earthquake</td></tr><tr><td>Rhyperior</td><td>Mud-Slap</td><td>Earthquake</td></tr><tr><td>Garchomp</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Earthquake</td></tr><tr><td>Landorus</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Earth Power</td></tr><tr><td>Excadrill</td><td>Mud-Slap</td><td>Drill Run</td></tr><tr><td>Krookodile</td><td>Mud-Slap</td><td>Earthquake</td></tr><tr><td>Golurk</td><td>Mud-Slap</td><td>Earth Power</td></tr><tr><td>Golem</td><td>Mud-Slap</td><td>Earthquake</td></tr><tr><td>Donphan</td><td>Mud-Slap</td><td>Earthquake</td></tr><tr><td>Mamoswine</td><td>Mud-Slap</td><td>Bulldoze</td></tr></tbody></table><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>If you do have some Shadow Pokémon available to counter Mega Manectric then you should try to use the following. Shadow Mamoswine, Shadow Mewtwo with Confusion and Pysstrike, Shadow Flygon with Mud Shot and Earth Power, or Shadow Swampert with Mud Shot and Earthquake.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>So that’s the best Mega Manectric counters in Pokémon GO, but what else do you need to know? Find out below in our full raid guide.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Pokémon GO Mega Manectric Raid Guide</h2><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Below you’ll find tips, tricks, and answers to frequently asked questions about Mega Manectric raids in Pokémon GO.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>When will Mega Manectric be Available</h3><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>Launching alongside the Charge Up! event, Mega Manectric raids will be available starting Tuesday, March 16th at 10am in your local time zone. We don’t have an end date just yet so you might have a while to fight and catch them, but don’t waste time if you want a lot of that Mega Energy.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>How Many Players are Needed</h3><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Like other Mega Raid battles, Mega Manectric puts up a tough challenge for most trainers. If you have a solid team of counters, are best friends with the other trainers, and have weather on your side you might be able to win with as few as three players. However, we recommend most teams go in with at least five or more players.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>What Weather Boosts</h3><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Here’s how weather works for your Mega Manectric raids.</p><ul data-found-items=2 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true><li>Rain – Boosts Mega Manectric</li><li>Sunny/Clear – Boosts your Ground counters</li></ul><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>Those are the most important, though Fog can also boost any Dark attacks, if you are short on Ground attackers.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Can Mega Manectric be Shiny</h3><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>Shiny Mega Manectric will be available immediately, though Mega Evolved Pokémon act a bit differently, of course. Once you have the 200 Manectric Mega Energy required to evolve one of your own you can use a previously caught Shiny Manectric if you’d like. After winning the raid you might encounter Shiny Manectric and be able to catch one of your own if you don’t.</p><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=110 data-injectable=false>And that’s our Pokémon GO Mega Manectric raid guide showing you how to beat him with the best counters.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
