After a new alleged piece of evidence was brought forward in the duo’s years-long<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>feud</a>, on March 21, the “Lover” songstress ‘liked’ several Tumblr posts which took her side against Kanye, and his wife&nbsp;<strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>. “Taylor told the truth mood board,” one Tumblr post read, which garnered a ‘like’ from the chart-topper. Another post, which Taylor liked, read, “How I sleep at night knowing we were right all this time and now we have the receipts to prove it.” Take from that what you will!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>It comes as an alleged new video was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>leaked</a>, seemingly showing Taylor and Kanye’s full conversation about his controversial 2016 track in which he called the 30-year-old a “b***h”. The song featured the lyric, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b***h famous.” Tay immediately slammed the track, taking issue with the fact she was referred to as “that b***h”, and has always maintained that Kanye never warned her about using that word. Months later, Kanye’s wife <strong>Kim Kardashian&nbsp;</strong>leaked a snippet of Taylor and Kanye’s conversation on Snapchat, leading to massive social media attacks against the pop singer, which she said forced her into hiding for nearly a year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Well, is it gonna be mean?” Swift can be heard asking on the other end of the line (watch and listen to the clip&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HERE</a>). Kanye goes on to share just the first part of the lyric, in which he originally quipped, “Taylor Swift might&nbsp;owe&nbsp;me sex.” Kanye then asks the “Blank Space” singer to debut the song on her own Twitter account, but she tells Kanye it would make the song “less cool” if she shared it. “People are just waiting for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame,” she says through the other end of the phone, explaining that she likes the fact the song isn’t “mean” and doesn’t call her a “b***h”.&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong>&nbsp;has reached out to Taylor’s and Kim’s rep for comment on the matter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kanye-west-taylor-swift-famous-lyrics-2016-phone-conversation-shutterstock-post-.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>It’s unclear where this leak came from, and the clip is yet to be verified by either party, however Taylor’s army of fans were quick to make the hashtags #KanyeIsOverParty and #TaylorSwiftWasRightAllAlong trend worldwide on Twitter. Many fans even noted that they were expecting an apology from Kim and Kanye. “I don’t want just a notes app apology. I want a video explaining why they manipulated, targeted, bullied and harassed a kind woman into going into a very dark, emotional place to the point she isolated herself, drank a lot and felt like her career was over,” one Swiftie tweeted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH10e5FrZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2htqyx0marrqWSob9uvM6sq6xlm5a7urGMsJysrF2hsqK3xJ1knJmcoXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./melody-valadez.html><span>←</span><span>Melody Valadez - Bio, Net Worth, In Relation, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
