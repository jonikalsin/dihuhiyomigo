ボーカルの吉田美和さんの歌唱力は、日本ロック界の中でずば抜けており、現在でもボーカリストの実力ランキングで上位に入ります。
女性1人に男性2人という構成は、“ドリカム編成”と言われ、その後もEvery Little Thingやいきものがかりらが続いたほどに影響力を持っていました。
これまでに多くのヒット曲を生み出したドリカムですが、近頃はメディアへの露出が減っています。
一部では「ドリカムは干された」という噂が出るほどに、名前を聞かなくなりました。
メンバーの2人に不仲説があったり、元々は音楽性が受ける気ないという苦手意識を持つ人が多かったり、悪い噂も多くあります。
今日はドリカムがメディアへの露出が減った理由と、吉田美和さんと中村正人さんの不仲説、そしてドリカムが苦手だという人の意見についてまとめてみたいと思います。
DREAMS COME TRUEが干された理由は強い海外思考故。掟破りのレコード移籍 最近では滅多に名前を聞かなくなったDREAMS COME TRUE。
かねてからネット上では”ドリカムが干されてる”との声が出ていました。
干されてる疑惑については、リーダーの中村正人さんがインタビューの中で赤裸々に告白しており、事実であることがわかっています。
中村さんは元々は海外で成功することを目指しており、「500万枚売ることと、グラミー賞を獲ること」を一生の夢と語っています。
全盛期の1998年にはアルバム「SING OR DIE」を全米でリリースし、海外進出にもチャレンジしていました。
当時について、後に中村正人さんはインタビューの中で、
我々は、イギリスやアメリカから学んだ音楽がこんなふうに日本で消化されたっていうのをアメリカのマーケットに見せたかったんです。アメリカはその当時ヒップホップが全盛で、ロックもちょっとオルタナになってたんで。だからファーイーストなアーティストが70年代の伝統的な音楽をやってるっていう、それを持っていきたかったんです
と、ドリカムの音楽がアメリカやイギリスの音楽を吸収した形でウケると考えていたみたいです。
その後も中村さんの海外の夢は終わらず、この海外進出に際して、DREAMS COME TRUEはかなり強引にレコード会社をヴァージンに移籍してしまうのです。
実は当時のこの行動が“業界の掟”を破る行為だったことから、その後に干される原因となったのです。ようです。
しかも義理も人情もなくね。あのときのドリカムにとって、それはやっちゃいけないことだったんです。 だから当然干されましたよね。テレビ局からは閉め出されるし。ラジオでも我々の曲はかからない。そこで一度、ドリカムは完全に死にましたね。
この時期から、ドリカムはメディアへの露出が減ったと言うことです。
当時、東芝EMIの担当者から、
「どこのラジオ局に行っても『中村がいる限りドリカムはうちの局ではかけない』って言われる」
「中村さんが土下座して回ってくれ」
と言われたそうです。
ちなみに、当時の吉田美和さんの反応は、
「事務所が守ってくれなくてマサさんが悪者になるなら、もう私たちでやろう」
と中村さんを責めずに、一緒に戦おうとしてくれたそうです。
そして、アメリカのマーケットから撤退し、日本で改めて事務所を作ったのです。
昔にお世話になった人に謝り続けながらも、5年ぐらいでようやく状況は改善されたそうです。 しかし、すでに業界との関係が修復されている割りには、メディアからドリカムの音楽が鳴ることは減りました。
シンプルに”売れなくなった””飽きられた”と言うことで、メディアが取り上げられなくなった可能性が高いです。
ドリカムは単純に飽きられて売れなくなった？メンバー脱退でファン離れも かつて業界の掟破りをしてしまい、日本の音楽業界からそっぽを向かれてしまったドリカム。
その後に関係は良くなりましたが、メディアへの露出の弱さなどは相変わらずです。
音楽の売り上げも伸び悩み、ファンも減ってしまった印象です。
ある時期から「ドリカムアレルギー」と言う言葉がネットで流行ったりと、かなり逆行が強いです。
今のドリカムは、業界に干されてしまったと言うよりも、リスナーの変化に対応できなく、単純に昔ほど人気がなくなってしまっただけと言うのが核心です。
ドリカムの吉田美和と中村正人に不仲説が出た理由。喧嘩やギャラ分配などの関係？ DREAMS COME TRUEといえばボーカルの吉田美和さんと、リーダーでベースの中村正人の2人コンビです。
長いキャリアの中で多くの成功が手に入ったのは、この二人の才能と協力関係があってこそでした。
しかし、仕事の相性は良くても、それ以外ではあまり雰囲気が良くなく、古くからファンに”吉田と中村は不仲なの？”と疑われていました。
不仲説が出るたびに、その説について2人のどちらかが否定していましたが、中村正人さんが2016年7月に放送された「関ジャム 完全燃SHOW」に出演すると、
「難しい人です。扱いにくい人間ですから」
「少女がそのまま大きくなった感じ」
「ぼくに対しては極悪の極みです」
と発言し、兼ねてからの不仲説を大まかに認めるようなことを口にしたのです。
さらには、吉田さんの隣で”良い人”のキャラクターを守るのが大変だという苦労も語り、放送直後はファンがSNSで様々な想いを書き連ねる事態となりました。
吉田美和と中村正人の不仲理由は音楽との向き合い方。嫌いな理由は人間性も含む これまでにドリカムのためにメディアでピエロを続けてきた中村正人さん。
「関ジャム 完全燃SHOW」ではレコーディングでの吉田美和さんにストレスを抱えていることを「（吉田と）音楽的にぶつかるというより、人間的に許せないですね」と告白していました。</description></item><item><title>Susan Shepherd Obituary:Remember Goodfellas And The Sopranos Actress Has Passed Away</title><link>/susan-shepherd-obituary.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/susan-shepherd-obituary.html</guid><description>In a bittersweet wave of reminiscence and reflection, the Eastlake community prepares to bid farewell to Susan L.
