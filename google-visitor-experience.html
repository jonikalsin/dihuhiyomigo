This new destination will give you the chance to experience Google and our hometown community — from a public cafe and a Google Store to an events space and pop-up shop featuring local businesses.</p><p>The Google Visitor Experience is located at the company’s new tent-like “Gradient Canopy” office building in Mountain View. It was previously called Charleston East, and is located at <a href=#>2000 N Shoreline Blvd, Mountain View, CA 94043</a>. There will be parking for visitors.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed alignwide is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>There are multiple parts to this upcoming space, starting with the first West Coast Google Store to buy and learn about Pixel hardware products. This is the third location following <a href=#>Chelsea</a> and <a href=#>Williamsburg</a> in New York City.&nbsp;</p><p>Other components include Google’s first-ever public “Cafe @ Mountain View” and “The Plaza” with outdoor art, events, and other programming.</p><p>There will also be a venue for local community group or non-profit events called “The Huddle” and a “Pop-Up Shop” space for local businesses.</p><p>Today, you can walk through the Google campus to see a dinosaur and <a href=#>some Android statues</a>, but it’s not a full experience. At best, it’s just taking pictures, especially since the gift store that sold company merchandise (and some hardware) closed a few years ago. This upcoming center is a full replacement, and should be particularly busy around I/O. It comes as Apple offers a similar experience, which has good albeit pricey snacks and seating, in Cupertino.</p><p>Teasing “a Googley experience waiting for you,” the Google Visitor Experience opens Thursday, October 12.&nbsp;You can <a href=#>find more information here</a>.</p><p class=disclaimer-affiliate>FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. <a href=#>More.</a></p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/08/08.29-09.02-750_150-buy-now.jpeg alt width=700 height=140 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhxpKSCqLvOoKOeZpOkunB%2Bj2tqaGhpZH14e8aopqCklWLDqr%2FIraarZZWtvaa%2ByJ6lnJ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./west-africa-squadron.html><span>←</span><span>Imperial Britain's Effort To End The Slave Trade</span></a>
