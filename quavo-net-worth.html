According to authoritative sources, this Lawrenceville born singer has the net worth of $4.3 million, which is accumulated from his career in the previously mentioned field.</p><h3>Quavo Net Worth $4.3 million</h3><p>When it comes to Quavo’s early life, his mother is a hairdresser, but he unfortunately lost his father at an early age. He grew up in Gwinnett County, a suburban area near Atlanta, alongside his relatives who would later on form Migos with him. Quavo attended Berkmar High School, where he played football, and although his body type didn’t meet the standards, he was a successful player, breaking school records in the sport; Marshall’s coach described him as ‘’very smart on the field, understood the offense and how to read the defense’’. Despite all of that, he dropped out of school without matriculating.</p><p>His music career began in 2009 as he decided to form Migos – originally Polo Club – joined by two fellow rappers, Takeoff and Offset; Quavo is Takeoff’s uncle and Offset’s cousin. Quavo was sharing his mixtape in school, and was made fun of for doing that, however, Takeoff and Offset joined him, and as the Polo clothing brand wasn’t considered fashionable anymore, the trio decided to rename their group and chose Migos as their new name.</p><p>They went on to release their first serious project, a mixtape released in August 2011 and entitled ‘’Juug Season’’, so also starting Quavo’s net worth.</p><p>They remained busy throughout the following period, and worked on the June 2012 mixtape ‘’No Label’’, however, Quavo made his big breakthrough when Migos released the single ‘’Versace’’, which became prominent in the music world. The remix of ‘’Versace’’ featured Drake, the world-wide known singer and just entered the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at 99, but also made it into the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at 31. He was named the most influential rapper of early 2014 by Complex Music, When it came to their next project, <a href=#>Migos</a> released ‘’Culture’’, their second album in January 2017, featuring 13 songs including the title song and ‘’T-Shirt’’ and ‘’ Get Right Witcha’’, with the latter being a result of a collaboration with <a href=#>Gucci Mane</a>, one of the most prominent singers in the rap world. The album was immensely successful, and took the first place of the Billboard 200 chart.</p><p>When it comes to Quavo’s future projects, it was revealed that he is working on a collaborative album with the rapper, <a href=#>Travis Scott</a>. Quavo is also expanding his solo career as he has worked with artists such as 2 Chainz and Kanye West on his single ‘’Champion’’. In early 2017, he also released his solo album ‘’ATL’’, featuring songs like ‘’Blackman’’, ‘’Trapstar’’ and ‘’Feels Me’’.</p><p>In his private life, Quavo and other members of <a href=#>Migos</a> were raised by Quavo’s mother. When it comes to his love life, he hasn’t share much information regarding that topic: there aren’t even any rumours, yet! In 2015, he and his two colleagues were the subject of a controversy when they were arrested for marijuana and illegal gun possession, and Quavo was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended on payment of a fine. His group is also active on social media websites such as Instagram, where they have an army of over five million followers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjsLC5jqqsmq6fYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mumtaz.html><span>←</span><span>Mumtaz</span></a>
