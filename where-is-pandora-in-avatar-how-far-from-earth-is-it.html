In stark contrast to the sharply defined craters of other moons, including Hyperion, the craters on Pandora are even covered in garbage. The small moon’s surface also seems to be characterized by intriguing ridges and grooves.</p><p>The closest star system to the Solar System of humans is the Alpha Centauri System, home to the livable extrasolar moon Pandora. It is the gas giant Polyphemus’ fifth moon, which orbits Alpha Centauri A. Humans have given both the moon’s and its mother planet’s names in honor&nbsp;of characters from Greek mythology.</p><p>Despite being almost as big as Earth, Pandora is merely one of the thirteen moons that the gas giant Polyphemus has. However, because it is smaller than Earth, its gravity is 20% lower.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Far_Away_Is_Pandora></span><strong>How Far Away Is Pandora?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pandora is portrayed as a planet that is, apparently, far away in space in the world of Avatar. It was never specifically mentioned in Avatar (2009) film, where Pandora was or how long it would take humans to get there, though, because of the rich plot of Avatar and the numerous aspects of Pandora that were explored.</p><p>According to estimates, <strong>Pandora is 4.37 light-years far from our planet</strong>. It would still take longer than four years to get there even if you traveled at the speed of light.</p><p>Actually, Pandora is a moon rather than a planet. There are only 14 moons in total orbiting the gas giant planet Polyphemus, and due to its smaller size, Pandora has less gravity than the others. The Na’vi people live on the planet Pandora.</p><p><strong>Also read : <a href=#>What is Coming to Disney+ in 2023?</a></strong></p><p>One of the most groundbreaking movies in science fiction of the past few decades, ‘Avatar’ is renowned for its stunning visuals, complex story, and multiple scientific components. It sets in the Alpha Centauri A system, which is a whole distinct star system from Earth. According to estimates, Pandora is 4.37 light years from our planet and orbits Saturn.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_FAQs></span><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_big_is_Pandora_compared_to_Earth></span><strong>How big is Pandora compared to Earth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When compared to An Activist Survival Guide, which states on page 6 that it has a diameter of 11447 km (about 89.7% of Earth’s equatorial diameter of 12756 km) and a mass of 72% of Earth, the object’s diameter is roughly three-quarters that of Earth and its mass is roughly half.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Pandora_from_Avatar_a_real_place></span><strong>Is Pandora from Avatar a real place?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The film takes place on the <strong>fictional planet of Pandora</strong>, one of the numerous moons of the hypothetical Saturn-sized gas giant Polyphemus, which is situated in the actual Alpha Centauri system, the nearest star system to Earth at a distance of roughly 4.4 light-years.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_did_it_take_to_travel_to_Pandora_in_Avatar></span><strong>How long did it take to travel to Pandora in Avatar?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It takes almost six years (five years, nine months, and 22 days) for JakeSully to reach Pandora in 2154, Avatar (2009) film.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_planet_near_Pandora></span><strong>What is the planet near Pandora?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The average radius of Pandora is 25.3 miles (40.7 kilometers).
