Brian is currently battling it out for the coveted Mirrorball Trophy on Season 30 of the ABC dancing competition series. <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>JoJo Siwa</a>, Melanie C, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kenya Moore</a></strong>, and<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Suni Lee</strong></a> are among the star-studded contestants.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Brian and Sharna, who have been dating since December 2020, recently performed the Rumba for Week 2 on September 27. Performed along to “Say You Won’t Let Go” by&nbsp;<strong>James Arthur</strong>, the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>performance was inspired by a romantic</a> date they had at the Original Immersive Van Gogh Exhibit in Los Angeles. They earned 23 out of 40 points for the performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sharna-burgess-brian-austin-green-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“So Sharna and I have been together for almost a year. It’s been kind of a storybook relationship,” Brian explained in the episode. “Just being there with her, feeling the emotions that came up it was great inspiration for what we’re going to perform.” His partner added, “It’s been an incredible 11 months of showing a person truly who I am. Complete vulnerability with each other and that’s new for me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Following the premiere of the episode, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brian and Sharna spoke to reporters</a> from various outlets, including <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>, about navigating the competition series as a couple. During the interview, Brian admitted to fears of “disappointing” his dancer pro girlfriend. “I have much more of a fear of disappointing her because when we first were really spending more time with each other and dating, she used to talk about the fact that it would be so great if we could dance together,” he said. “Not on the show, but just in general.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“And I was always like, ah, because that scares the crap out of me because she’s a dancer,” Brian continued. “So then coming here, it was like, man, if this doesn’t go well, I could crush that dream for her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FyZqygkae7onnBrqmgnaOoeqm7y52qZqCRo7G0ecGroJqmXZbCtMDIp2SgqpWau26w1q2qZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rosalyn-gold-onwude-everything-you-need-to-know-about-her.html><span>←</span><span>Rosalyn Gold Onwude- Everything You Need To Know About Her</span></a>
